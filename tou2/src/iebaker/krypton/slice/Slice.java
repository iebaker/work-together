/**
 * The class Slice specifically represents a <em>way</em> to divide a node into sub nodes by placing vertical or horizontal
 * slices through this node, partitioning it into smaller regions of screen real-estate which are linked to the progenitor node
 * in a child-parent relation. A single Slice object can be thought of like a programmable cookie-cutter for Node objects.  Idiomatic
 * use can utilize double-brace initialization when passing a slice object to a divide call, for example
 * <blockquote>
 * <code>
 * my_example_node.divide(new Slice() 
 * <blockquote>
 * 		{{ type(T.BASIC); direction(D.VERT); splits(0.5f, 0.25f); padding(10f); names("top", "middle", "bottom"); }}  
 * </blockquote>
 * );</code>
 * </blockquote>
 * The above code divides <code>my_example_node</code> into three sections: top, which is 50% of the total height, middle, which
 * is 25% of the total height, and bottom which is the leftover (also 25%).  There is a 10 pixel padding between each child node,
 * the axis divided was the vertical one, and the type is basic.  The nodes are given names in order from top down: "top", 
 * "middle", and "bottom"  Other types can split a node evenly into N child nodes, or
 * divide the nodes into blocks of fixed pixel heights which either space themselves evenly through the splitting dimension of 
 * the parent node, or slide to one side according to the Gravity of the parent node.
