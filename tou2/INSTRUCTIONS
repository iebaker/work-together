You are the blue rectangle (the blue dot is your ... plasma phaser or something).  Use the arrow keys to rotate, forward to move ahead, and backwards to do a 180 degree direction switch.  Your health and bullets left are displayed at the top of the screen.  The red circles are your enemies.  They shoot bullets at you.  Press space to fire bullets back.  Single green squares are extra bullets.  Groups of four pink squares are extra health.
